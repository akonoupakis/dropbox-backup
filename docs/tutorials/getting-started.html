<p>So, here is a quick start<br />
dropbox-backup uses the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/archiver" target="_blank">archiver</a> module for archiving the output file and exposes its functionality to the end user.</p>

<p>Reference its api documentation at <a href="http://archiverjs.com/docs/" target="_blank">http://archiverjs.com/docs/</a></p>

<h4>Processing as a scheduled task</h4>
<p>This will upload the archived file in daily/weekly/monthly folders skipping the upload if its not its time yet.<br />
It keeps the last 3 uploads in each folder so that if needed to rollback further ago in the timeline, an older backup from the weekly/monthly folders can be found  
</p>

    var <a href="DropboxBackup.html">DropboxBackup</a> = require('dropbox-backup');
    var backup = new <a href="DropboxBackup.html">DropboxBackup</a>({
        key: "DROPBOXKEY",
        secret: "DROPBOXSECRET",
        token: "DROPBOXTOKEN"
    });

    backup.run(function (x) {
        // add a directory to the archive
        x.archive.directory('./lib', 'lib');

        // add a file to the archive
        x.archive.file('file.txt', { name: 'lib/file.txt' });

        // upload the archive to dropbox. 
        // this takes an optional callback function should you need to continue
        x.<a href="DropboxArchive.html#upload">upload</a>(function (err) {
            if (err)
                throw err;
            else
                console.log('completed');
        });
    });
      
</pre>

<h4>Processing on demand</h4>
<p>Should you want to run on demand the backup process, all it needs is a name for the file.<br />
In this case, the uploaded files in the root, are not being removed in favor of newer uploads.

    backup.run('filename', function (x) {
        ...
